# Lab 04 — Business-logic attack detection

Detect multi-request authorization abuse (BOLA/IDOR) and workflow-sequence skips, and confirm that structurally identical AUTHORIZED activity is allowed.

## Objectives
- Detect an object-authorization violation across requests.
- Detect an out-of-order workflow step.
- Confirm authorized, in-order activity produces no finding.

## Prerequisites
- Go 1.25+; this repository cloned. No network or external target is needed.
- Recommended: complete the preceding labs first.

## Setup
Nothing to install. The lab generates its own deterministic synthetic data.

## Run
```bash
go test -v ./labs/04-business-logic
```

## Tasks & expected observations
Follow the numbered steps printed by the test. Each `✓` line is an expected
observation; each check that fails prints a remediation hint prefixed
`LAB CHECK FAILED`.

## Validation & grading
The test **is** the automated grader: a green `ok` line means every objective
was met against the real engine. There is no separate answer key in this public
repo (see [../README.md](../README.md) on public vs. private materials).

## Reset
Re-run the command above. The lab is deterministic (fixed seeds); there is no
leftover state.

## Instructor notes
Model answers, scoring rubrics, and any private challenge variants are kept in
the separate private instructor repository, not here.
